Voting made faster, smarter, and more secure.

The 2020 election is truly unique. In the era of Covid-19, mail-in voting has
taken center stage...As first time voters,... ballootproof...support for...

## Introduction
With an increasing emphasis on social distancing and remote engagement as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, mail-in voting surged from 24.9% to 50.3% of ballots in the 2016 and 2020 primaries respectively. With this surge in mail-in ballots, this also means that an increasing amount of ballots are rejected due to human error in the mail-in ballot. In an effort to reduce rejection rates, we introduce BallotProof, a method for fast, smart, and secure checking of ballots.

## What It Does
BallotProof is built from the ground up with ease of use and security in mind. As a result, the platform was developed with a serverless structure, with all image analysis done on the client-side. BallotProof takes in input images of the front and back sides of your ballot and uses image analysis to (PRATH START HERE)

## Notice
ALL BALLOT IMAGES ARE AUTOGENERATED BY A COMPUTER FROM A SINGULAR SAMPLE BALLOT
THESE BALLOTS DO NOT EXIST PHYSICALLY, AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE SUBMITTED AT A
POLLING LOCATION OR BE SENT IN THE MAIL.

The generation script (generate.py) enables the generation of semi-randomized
ballots that fit certain satisfiability criteria. We use these sample ballots
as tests for model functionality.
